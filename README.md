## Requirements
* We must work only with pure HTML and CSS.
* We are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap, MUI...).
* We are not to use Javascript.
* The web page has to be responsive.

## Best practices to follow
* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
* avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

## Design informations
* max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
* the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
* links hover/active: #FF6565
* button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
