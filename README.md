# holberton-headphones
* This is a fullstack web specialization project at Holberton school.
* The goal of this project is a implement a Figma design template in HTML and CSS only.
* The project has no guiding instructions.
* There are 3 different layout (desktop, tablet and mobile).
* The template should be fully responsive.

## Requirements
* We must work only with pure HTML and CSS.
* We are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap, MUI...).
* We are not to use Javascript.
* The web page has to be responsive.

## Best practices to follow
* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
* avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
